let count = 0;

// Answer
count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// This line (line 3), is updating the value of the count variable. The = operator is an assignment operator which assigns the value on the right (count + 1) to the variable on the left (count).
