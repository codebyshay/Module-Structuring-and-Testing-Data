// trying to create an age variable and then reassign the value by 1

let age = 33;
age = age + 1;
console.log(age);

// The code above will output 34, because we are reassigning the value of age to be the current value of age plus 1. So, 33 + 1 = 34.
// The error in the code is that it was trying to reassign a value to a variable that was declared with let. This is not allowed in JavaScript.
